Problem:


Fixed:
1) Checkout Incomplete List [done for label & price]
- List Out Each Label & Price
2) Delete Addon Menu List

2) - base price(exp) = 4 
   - addon(must have purchase one exclude quantity) - only 1(exp) =  1+2+3+4 = (10)
   - quantity = 1
   - total = 14

Auth Problem :
- 1) User can see other people order, when payment it affect other order status account.

Plan:
- 1) Set Auth on order express api
- 2) Rebuild structure of order database
